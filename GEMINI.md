# Repository Instructions For Gemini

## Goal
Make small, safe, reviewable changes that fit the existing project.

## General Rules
- Inspect the repository before proposing or applying changes.
- Keep diffs focused on the user's request.
- Do not refactor unrelated files.
- Preserve existing project conventions.
- Treat secrets, tokens, and credentials as sensitive. Never print them in full.
- Do not fabricate command, tool, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Gemini, or CI output.

## Available Agent Modes
Use the matching mode when the task fits its domain:

- `csharp-developer`: C# and .NET application code, console apps, MSAL or Microsoft Identity integration, NuGet/project file updates, tests, refactoring, debugging, nullable safety, and async code.
- `sre-engineer`: Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube, GitHub Actions, Makefiles, run scripts, Azure, deployment automation, reliability, and operational readiness.

## Agent Mode Instructions
@./.gemini/agents/csharp-developer.md
@./.gemini/agents/sre-engineer.md

## Gemini CLI Skills
This repository also exposes matching workspace skills through `.agents/skills`, which Gemini CLI can discover:

- `.agents/skills/csharp-developer/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/sre-engineer/SKILL.md`

Use `/skills list` to confirm discovery and `/skills reload` after editing skill files.

## Validation
- Prefer repository-specific build and test commands when they exist.
- If validation cannot run because local tooling is unavailable, say exactly what was not run and why.

## Final Response
Include:
- Summary
- Files changed
- Commands run
- Verification result
